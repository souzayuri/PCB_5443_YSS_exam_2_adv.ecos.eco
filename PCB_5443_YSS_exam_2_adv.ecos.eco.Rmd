## **Part I: Develop a question or questions that motivate the time-series analysis of the data you chose (10 points). 
### **A:** 
- Does the defaunation of medium and large herbivores affect plant abundance? 

## **Part II: Use a time-series model to analyze the data (pick one of the three models, or you may chose to use more than one model). Include the data, the R scripts, figures, and model output (50 points).
### **A:** 
- All the data and code are available ***[here](https://github.com/souzayuri/PCB_5443_YSS_exam_2_adv.ecos.eco)*** and included in the last pages of this file.

## **Part III: Interpret the results of your data (in 1-2 paragraphs) using descriptions of the model output (qualitative and quantitative) and characteristics of pulse dynamics described in Jentsch and White (2019) (40 points).
### **A:** 

- Explaing the experiment

- Interestingly, closed plots experienced an abundance boom while open plots kept almost constant. Although my predictions was that this exercise would target the peaks, it seems that the results is quite on the opposite, showing the valies insteads. Both treatments had the same peak patterns and within the same year period (with the exception of 2014, present only in closed plots while 2015 was absent). I hypothesize that maybe the data structure is not suitable enough for this method to capture the peaks precisely, as there were only 10 years of data sample comprising 2 measurements per year.

- All the patterns shown here goes in the opposite direction of my prediction that plant abundance would increase in closed plots, as shown by previous studies in the same experiment (XXX and XXX). Moreover, graph A show a clear increase in the abundance right after the beginning of the experiment, with both lines starting almost at the same intercept. Although the first years did not show a large variation, visually, peaks and valleys are present after 2014, more than was captures by the model. 

- Further amaryllises should incorporate the valley *quantmod* method as well as the rate of plant mortality and recruitment. Moreover, exploring the time series at the site level might be more suitable as each location has a large variability on plant dynamic.


Open (Peaks per year: 0.4, average peak magnitude: 1290, peak standard deviation: 76.75, peak CV: 0.05)
model 1: Slope: 0.14, *P-value* = 0.15 - Did time affected the occurance of peaks? No
model 2: Slope: -0.64, *P-value* = 0.35 - Has the magnitude of peaks increased/decreased over time?? No

Closed (Peaks per year: 0.4, average peak magnitude: 1981.75, peak standard deviation: 95.17, peak CV: 0.04)
model 1: Slope: 0.56, *P-value* = 0.08 - Did time affected the occurance of peaks? Almost
model 2: Slope: -0.10, *P-value: 0.89* - Has the magnitude of peaks increased/decreased over time?? No
